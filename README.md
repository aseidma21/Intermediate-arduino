# Intermediate Arduino
Assignments: LED blink revisited, Hello LCD, LCD backpack, Photointerupters, Potentiometers, Motor Control

## LED blink revisited

What it does: Makes an LED fade in and out using a function

What I learned: I learned how to use analogWrite, and how to use a function to make an LED fade in and out

Struggles: It was hard for me to use analogWrite instead of digitalWrite, and to understand why I had to, but overall this was a pretty basic assignment

## Hello LCD

What it does:Prints out "Hello World" on the top line of the LCD, and under that prints out the time in seconds

What I learned: How to wire and code an LCD

Struggles: The LCD concept was a totally new concept with wiring and coding, so that was kind of tough

Code: https://github.com/aseidma21/Intermediate-arduino/blob/master/Hello%20LCD/LCD%20hello%20world.ino

## LCD Backpack

What it does: Uses an LCD backpack to control the brightness of the LCD and to simplify all the wiring

What I learned: How to wire an LCD backpack, and use modified coding to code it

Code: https://github.com/aseidma21/Intermediate-arduino/blob/master/LCD%20backpack/LCD%20backpack.ino

## Photointerrupters

What it does: The light is on, but when you put something in between the photointerrupter's legs, the light turns off because it has disrupted the flow

What I learned: How to wire and code a photointerrupter

Struggles: I'm not very good at booleans at all and I had to use one for this assignment

Code: https://github.com/aseidma21/Intermediate-arduino/blob/master/photointerupter/photointerupter.ino

## Potentiometers

What it does: Uses a potentiometer to have its value shown on the LED screen, and controling the brightness. So it gets brighter and drarker, and show how bright/dark it is

What I learned: How to code and wire a potentiometer

Struggles: The wiring was a little hard on the assignment, but the coding was pretty straightforward

Code: https://github.com/aseidma21/Intermediate-arduino/blob/master/potentimeters2/potentimeters2.ino

## Motor Control

What it does: Controls the speed and direction of the motor based on the potentiometer

What I learned: How to wire a diode and transister, and control a motor with a potentiometer

Struggles: If it didn't work, you had to figure out if the diode was the wrong way, and the transistor, or if one of them was just bad, or if your wiring was wrong, or if your coding was wrong. There were just a lot of variables

Code: https://github.com/aseidma21/Intermediate-arduino/blob/master/motor_control/Motor_control.ino
