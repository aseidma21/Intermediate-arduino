# Intermediate Arduino
Assignments: LED blink revisited, Hello LCD, LCD backpack, Photointerupters, Potentiometers, Motor Control

##LED blink revisited

What it does: Makes an LED fade in and out using a function

What I learned: I learned how to use analogWrite, and how to use a function to make an LED fade in and out

Struggles: It was hard for me to use analogWrite instead of digitalWrite, and to understand why I had to, but overall this was a pretty basic assignment

## Hello LCD

What it does:Prints out "Hello World" on the top line of the LCD, and under that prints out the time in seconds

What I learned: How to wire and code an LCD

Struggles: The LCD concept was a totally new concept with wiring and coding, so that was kind of tough
