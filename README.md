# Intermediate Arduino
Assignments: 
##LED blink revisited

What it does: Makes an LED fade in and out using a function

What I learned: I learned how to use analogWrite, and how to use a function to make an LED fade in and out

Struggles: It was hard for me to use analogWrite instead of digitalWrite, and to understand why I had to, but overall this was a pretty basic assignment
